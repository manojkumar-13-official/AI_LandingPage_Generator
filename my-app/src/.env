Write clean, modern, and fully responsive HTML pages for the ${category} product called ${idea}. The mini-site should include three pages designed for optimal user experience and engagement:

            Landing Page (main page)

            Create a highly engaging, bold main heading with the product name ${idea} that highlights its innovation and appeal.
            Develop a concise, captivating subheading that clearly communicates the product’s value proposition.
            Design three compelling feature cards with illustrative icons, descriptive titles, and engaging short descriptions that capture the essence of each feature.
            Include a strong call-to-action button, like “Get Started” or “Buy Now,” with animations that draw attention.
            Consider using a combination of bold colors for headers and buttons, and softer hues for background elements to maintain visual hierarchy.
            Use high-contrast colors between text and background to ensure readability and accessibility for all users.
            Background Colors:

            For the landing page, use a gradient or subtle pattern to give depth, opting for colors that complement the product theme.
            On feature pages, use light backgrounds to make content pop while avoiding overwhelming visuals.
            Text and Icon Colors:

            Use dark, contrasting colors for text to ensure easy readability against lighter backgrounds.
            Employ accent colors that align with the brand identity for icons and feature card titles.
            Button Styles:

            Utilize bright, bold colors for call-to-action buttons to make them stand out; add hover effects that slightly darken or lighten the button color to provide feedback.
            Ensure button text contrasts well with the button background color for clear visibility.
            Animation and Transition Effects:

            Integrate subtle color changes in animations and transitions to guide users naturally through interactive elements.
            Ensure animations do not detract from functionality or accessibility, maintaining balance between aesthetics and user experience.
